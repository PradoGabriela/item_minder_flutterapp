4. **Documentation**: Issues labeled `documentation`

### Before You Start

- Check if someone is already working on the issue
- Comment on the issue to express interest
- Discuss your approach for larger changes
- Create an issue for new features before implementing

## üíª Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-barcode-scanner`
- `bugfix/fix-sync-issue`
- `docs/update-readme`
- `refactor/optimize-managers`

### Making Changes

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   flutter test
   flutter run --debug
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of changes"
   ```

5. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìè Coding Standards

### Dart/Flutter Style

Follow the official [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style):

```dart
// ‚úÖ Good
class ItemManager {
  Future<void> addCustomItem({
    required String brandName,
    required String description,
  }) async {
    // Implementation
  }
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
class itemmanager {
  void addcustomitem(String brandname, String description) {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### Architecture Guidelines

1. **Manager Pattern**
   - Use manager classes for business logic
   - Never bypass managers for direct Hive access
   - Keep UI and business logic separated

2. **Firebase Integration**
   - Use Firebase managers for all Firebase operations
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Add comprehensive debug logging

3. **Error Handling**
   ```dart
   try {
     await someOperation();
     debugPrint('‚úÖ Operation successful');
   } catch (e) {
     debugPrint('‚ùå Operation failed: $e');
     // Handle error appropriately
   }
   ```

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, descriptive comments
- Document public methods and classes
- Include usage examples for complex functions
- Use emoji prefixes in debug logs for easy filtering

```dart
/**
 * CRITICAL METHOD: Synchronizes items between Firebase and local storage
 * 
 * This method handles complex 3-way synchronization:
 * 1. Items to REMOVE (exist locally but not in Firebase)
 * 2. Items to ADD (exist in Firebase but not locally)  
 * 3. Items to UPDATE (exist in both but Firebase is newer)
 * 
 * @param groupID The group identifier
 * @param items List of items to synchronize
 * @return true if sync successful, false otherwise
 */
Future<bool> synchronizeItems(String groupID, List<AppItem> items) async {
  // Implementation
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

Write unit tests for:
- Manager class methods
- Utility functions
- Data model operations

```dart
// test/unit/item_manager_test.dart
void main() {
  group('ItemManager', () {
    test('should add item successfully', () async {
      // Arrange
      final itemManager = ItemManager();
      
      // Act
      await itemManager.addCustomItem(/* ... */);
      
      // Assert
      expect(/* validation */, isTrue);
    });
  });
}
```
